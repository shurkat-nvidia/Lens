"""Canonical no-op fallbacks for when nemo-lens telemetry is not active.

These match the nemo.lens public API signatures so that instrumented code
works unchanged regardless of whether telemetry is initialised.

Consumer libraries should use these as their ImportError fallback::

    try:
        from nemo.lens.groups import SpanRegistry
        from nemo.lens.helpers import managed_span
        from nemo.lens.state import is_span_group_enabled
    except ImportError:
        from nemo.lens.fallbacks import SpanRegistry, managed_span, is_span_group_enabled

``SpanRegistry`` is here because a consuming library registers the groups it
emits at import time, which has to keep working when lens is absent.
