    ``BatchSpanProcessor`` only emits a span on ``on_end``, so a span still open
    when the process exits is never exported -- which silently drops exactly the
    long-lived spans that wrap a whole run. This tracks in-flight spans and ends
    the leftovers on shutdown.

    Must be registered BEFORE the ``BatchSpanProcessor``: ``TracerProvider``'s
    default ``SynchronousMultiSpanProcessor`` shuts its children down in
    registration order, so ending a straggler here still reaches a live batch
    processor via ``on_end``, and its own shutdown then flushes the queue. This
    ordering is the whole design, and it does NOT hold for
    ``ConcurrentMultiSpanProcessor``, whose ``shutdown`` runs in parallel -- do
    not swap the provider's ``active_span_processor`` for that one.

    A force-closed span carries ``nemo.span.truncated`` and a matching event: its
    end time is the shutdown time, not the true end, and a consumer must be able
    to tell the difference.

    ``force_flush`` is deliberately a no-op -- it runs mid-run to push already
    ended spans and must not terminate live ones.
