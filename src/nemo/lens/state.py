"""Module-level span group state — importable anywhere without circular deps.

Holds a frozenset of enabled span groups so that any module can call
:func:`is_span_group_enabled` without importing the full nemo.lens package.

Two ways in, and the last one called wins:

* :func:`set_span_group_spec` stores the raw user spec (e.g. ``"default,step"``)
  and resolves it against :class:`~nemo.lens.groups.SpanRegistry`. It never
  raises: an entry naming nothing is warned about and kept pending, because this
  process's registry is not the authority on a job-wide spec. Several processes
  in one job routinely share a spec while importing different libraries, so a
  name that resolves nowhere here may be perfectly valid next door.

  The spec is retained, so a library registering late still takes effect
  (:func:`refresh_enabled_span_groups`) instead of silently emitting nothing.
  That path warns — see ``SpanRegistry._warn_if_late``.
* :func:`set_enabled_span_groups` pins an explicit set and drops the spec, so a
  later registration cannot reopen it. This is how a disabled process stays
  disabled, and how a test enables exactly the groups it means to.

Before either is called every :func:`is_span_group_enabled` query returns
``False``.
